# Vue 3 Boilerplate

This boilerplate provides a ready-to-use setup for developing with Vue 3 using Vite. It comes pre-configured with essential tools and libraries to jumpstart your Vue 3 project development.

## Features

- Vue 3
- Vue Router for routing
- Pinia for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Custom fonts configuration
- Vue ReCaptcha 3 integration

## Regular Updates

This boilerplate is actively maintained and new features will be added regularly. Stay tuned for updates to benefit from the latest improvements and integrations.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) for the best development experience.

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

## Customization

You can further customize the configuration by referring to the [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

This boilerplate is designed to get you started quickly with Vue 3 development, providing a solid foundation with essential tools and libraries pre-configured. Feel free to modify and extend it to suit your project needs.
